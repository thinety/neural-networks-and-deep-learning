Implementation of the code in the book [`Neural Networks and Deep Learning`](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

Train and test data are from the MNIST database of handwritten digits (download available [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)). The downloaded files were placed inside the `data` directory for correct functioning of the scripts.
